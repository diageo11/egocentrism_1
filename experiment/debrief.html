Thank you for taking part in this study. We are interested in understanding how people speak when communicating with a partner. Specifically, we are interested in how people refer to objects when they see something that their partner cannot see. We also are interested in how people refer to objects than are visible to both themselves and their partner. We are measuring whether people use terms like "big" and "small" more often when that information is more helpful to their partner. We also were interested in how your perception of your partner - whether the partner had a human voice or a computer voice - influenced how you communicated.

    <p>Your partner for this game was a computer and all instructions were pre-recorded. Your skill in following your partner's instructions was not measured.

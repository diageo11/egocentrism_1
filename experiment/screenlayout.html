<h2>Research Activity:</h2>

<p>You will be asked to play a picture naming and matching game with a partner. Today, your partner will be <b>another participant</b>. You will be connected to your partner before you start playing the game. </p>

<p>You and your partner will see matching grids of images. If you see an image with a red box around it, you should ask your partner to click on that object. If you do not see a red box around any image, your partner will ask you to click on an object. You will take turns, alternating between clicking or telling your partner which picture to click. </p> 

<p> The aim of this game is to complete the naming and clicking tasks as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

 <p> When it is your turn to ask your partner what to click, <b>press and hold the T key to activate your microphone.</b> Turns will advance each time the clicking partner clicks on an object. </p> 

<h2>Screen layout:</h2>

<p> <b>There will be some objects that only you can see.</b> These will have <b>grey backgrounds</b> for you and be blacked out for your partner.</p>


<p><b>There are also some objects that only your partner can see.</b> These are <b>blacked out</b> for you and have grey backgrounds for your partner. </p>
	
<p>See the example below of what each partner might see on a given turn.

    <img src="partnerB.png" alt="Partner B" style="width:100%" class="center">
      <span class="figcaption">Partner B's screen</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In this example, Partner A might say "click the fish" and the turn would end when Partner B clicked on the fish. Partner A can see the tree and the bird, while Partner B cannot. Partner B can see the window and the rainclouds, while Partner A cannot</p>

# Grid Game

This is the experiment code for an egocentrism study examining scalar modifier use when given privileged information. It contains two conditions, one where the partner is a computer agent, and another where the partner is a human agent. The experiment is a modified digital version of the Yoon, Koh, and Brown-Schmidt (2012) paper. Please consult that paper for further details on the methodology.

## The code

The experiment is designed to run online and is built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. Additionally, the jsPsych library (de Leeuw, 2015) is used as it considered a reliable way to automate common functions of experiments. Please visit the [jsPsych website](https://www.jspsych.org/) for tutorials and further information. The experiment can be currently found at the [UCD HCI Research Lab website](https://icsresearch.ucd.ie/grid_game/experiment/experiment.html).

## The Results

At the end of the experiment, different information is collected from each participant. First, participants will be given a 15

# Warning

This experiment is made to be run on a server, and so will break if ran locally.
